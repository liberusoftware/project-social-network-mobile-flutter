# Social Network · Flutter · Mobile

Profiles, feeds, communities and moderation. Flutter iOS/Android application using Dart and mobile widgets.

This is a presentation skeleton. Product workflows, identity integration and reviewed API adapters must be implemented and verified before production use. Module plans describe intended behavior; they are not installed or published packages.

Based on [project-boilerplate-mobile-flutter](https://github.com/liberusoftware/project-boilerplate-mobile-flutter) at `c88312adadb2bdbc85b9b20be36cbc3a711e9a64`.

## Start locally

Clone this repository, enter its directory and use the declared toolchain and committed lockfiles:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

Use `flutter build appbundle` for Android and `flutter build ipa` on macOS for iOS. Review signing, permission prompts, deep links and background/resume behavior. The native host is Flutter; application code and reusable contracts are Dart. Public `--dart-define` values cannot hold secrets. Physical-device and signed platform release checks are required before distribution and are not established by widget tests.

## Verify and extend

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [integration responsibilities](docs/INTEGRATION.md), the [presentation runbook](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/guides/presentation/FLUTTER.md) and the [product scope](https://github.com/liberusoftware/documentation/blob/main/projects/social-network/README.md). Enable one vertical journey at a time against reviewed contracts. Verify allowed, denied, wrong-tenant, expired-session, validation and concurrency outcomes when implementing protected behavior. A pending operation is not a completed business transition.
